This is a readme file for the perl script "unscranble.pl"

Purpose of this sript------------------------------------
Script was originally made for the mission at
http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/prog/1/

Usage----------------------------------------------------
You will need 2 other files apart from the script itself.
First is the library file, so-called wordlist file.
It is recommended that the file name be wordlist.txt
However, you may edit the script and use whatever name you like.

Second is an empty file for writing in the words you have to unscranble.
As for the Hack This Site mission, you can simply copy the requested words
and paste them to a file named "to_unscranble.txt"

I did try to make direct standard input available but copy-and-pasting to the
console wasn't supported in my environment so... sorry :(
