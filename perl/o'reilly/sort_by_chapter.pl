# Simple utility script for managing exercise problems on "Learning Perl" and
# "Beyond the basics of Learning Perl" from O'Reilly.
#
# Given a directory name, this script looks for .pl files in that directory
# and moves them into directories named like "chapterXX" by looking at the
# file names. For example, "chapter2-4.pl" (practice problem 4 in chapter 2)
# will be moved to "chapter02". Directories are created if they don't exist.
#
# Nested directories are NOT supported. The script only looks at the given
# directory and no further (deeper).
