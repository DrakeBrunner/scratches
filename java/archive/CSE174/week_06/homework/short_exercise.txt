2. Playing Compiler
a. It contains no errors but the loop never ends because i doesn't change after the loop.
b. system.out.println causes error. First letter should be upper case. loop ends after one looping since the evaluation will be "true" after first loop.
c. It causes an error that the evaluation done compares incompatible types.  When changing (j = 1) to (j == 1), it causes an infinite loop.
d. It doesn't cause an error but the loop will not be executed since the first evaluation turns out false.
e. float should be changed into double. After changing, the loop will print from 0.0 to 4.999999999999938.
f. It doesn't cause an error. It will print from 0.0 to 4.999999999999938.
g. Variable can't be found. 
h. Displays 3 and ends loop
i. Error since there is no semicolon. It will infinitely print "This looks correct."
j. Infinitely continues incrementing x
k. Prints nothing.
l. Prints 10
m. Error. Deleting the first while would print 1
n. Error. for (k = 0; k == 1; k++) will print nothing.
o. Error. After swapping the braces and the parentheses, it pritns 7
p. Error. After adding the semicolon, it prints from 0 to 99
q. Prints from 0 to 99
r. Infinitely prints 0
s. Prints even number from 0 to 98
t. Infinitely prints -1

7. Loop Rewriting
a.
int i = 0;
int sum = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    sum = sum + i * i;
    i++;
}

b.
int sum;
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    sum = 0;
    int j = 0;
    while (j <= i) {
        sum = sum + j;
        j++;
    }
    System.out.println(sum);
    i++;
}

c.
int i = 0;
int sum = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println(sum);
    sum += i++;
}

8. Find the Error
a. Condition has to be in parentheses. It never increments variable count so it never ends.

b. It increments after a loop so it never ends. Also, it is just being substituted so it does not do addition.

c. Apostrophe and double quotation is not corresponding. Also, variable sum must be declared outside for loop.

d. Variable sum is not declared. input.nextInt() used as expression asks the user for input once again after the evaluation.
