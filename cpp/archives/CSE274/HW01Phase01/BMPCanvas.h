/***
 * BMP : The Windows Bitmap image format
 * BMP files are binary files that represent color images. In this assignment you won't need to know much
 * about them, except for the following:
 * A BMP file consists of a 54-byte header, followed by 3*width*height bytes of data.
 * I have provided two methods, readHeader and writeHeader, which should handle the header: You should not
 * have to worry about it. As for the rest: Each pixel of the image is represented by 3 bytes of data.
 * A byte is an 8-bit integer, so each byte represents a number between 0 and 255. Each pixel is made up
 * of a triple of these: First for red, then green, then blue. So, for example, the triple (0, 0, 0) represents
 * black, (255, 255, 255) represents white, (255, 0, 0) represents red, (255, 255, 0) represents yellow, and so on.
 * Much more about RGB colors can be found by searching online.
 *
 * The key point is that, for each pixel of the image, you will want to call the write() method of your ofstream
 * three times, printing the three color values that will define the points color.
