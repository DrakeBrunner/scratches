/*
 * Purpose: This function should use a BMPCanvas object to create an image of a white square on a black background.
 *          It should then save this image as square256.bmp. 
 * Coloring rule: The pixel at (x,y) should be white only if x >= 64,  x < 192, y >= 64, and y < 192

 Coloring rule: The center of the sphere will be at (128, 128). 
 The color of the pixel should be given by the following code:

	int distanceSquared = (x-128)*(x-128) + (y-128)*(y-128);
	int color_value = 0;
	if(distanceSquared <= (90*90)){	        
		color_value = (255*((90*90)-distanceSquared))/(90*90);
	}
	Color C = Color(color_value, color_value, color_value);   // Keeping all values the same dictates a shade of grey

 *          In other words, the color starts off white at the center, then falls off linearly with the squared 
 *          distance from the center

/* 
 *Purpose: Convert point coordinates to a complex number.

 *         * x,y are the coordinates of the point to be coordinated
 *         * reMin and reMax are the minimum and maximum values of the real compontent to be represented.
 *         * imMin and imMax are the minimum and maximum values of the imaginary component to be represented.
 *         * width and height are the dimensions of the canvas.
 *         The function will return the complex number a + bi where:
 *                  a = reMin + x*(reMax-reMin)/(width - 1.0)
 *                  b = imMin + y*(imMax-imMin)/(height - 1.0)

/*
 * Purpose: Determine how fast the "fractal function" f diverges by finding the smallest i such that z(i,c) > 2,
 *          but returning numIterations if z(j,c) <= 2 for all j from 0 to numIterations.
 *          As defined in the documentation, the "fractal function" z is calculated as follows:
 *               z(0,c) = c
 *               z(1,c) = z(0,c)*z(0,c) + k
 *               z(2,c) = z(1,c)*z(1,c) + k
 *               ...
 *               z(i,c) = z(i-1,c)*z(i-1,c) + k
 *          The function will return the first i such that z(i,c) > 2, or return numIterations if it finds that 
 *          z(i,c) <= 2 for all i < numIterations.
 * Important: when you compare a complex number to a real number (e.g., z(i, c) > c ), you should
 *            actually compare the absolute value of that complex number to the real number (e.g., abs(z(i,c)) > c).

/*
 * Purpose: Generate a Julia set on a canvas with the adjustment value k.
 *          -- Canvas dimensions of 1000x1000
 *          -- Map this on the complex plane using reMin = imMin = -1.5 and reMax = imMax = 1.6
 *          -- Get this working in black-and-white, then add color.
 *
 * Black-and-white: For each point on the canvas, convert it to the appropriate complex number c and call
 *                  f = FractalDivergeCount(c, k, 100).  Plot a black point if < 100, and a white
 *                  point otherwise.
 *
 * Grey: We can add in shades of grey if we modify the intensity of the color by multiplying 255 by an "intensity
 *      modifier" -- a value between 0 and 1.  Two suggested modifiers that will work well are:
 *                     double intensity = f/100.0
 *      and
 *                     double intensity = pow( sin((double)f), 2) 
 *      now plot each point with color (255*intensity, 255*intensity, 255*intensity), where intensity is recalculated
 *      for each point.
 *
 * Color: Adding color just means making the intensity different for the different color fields.  For example:
 *        Using color (0, 0, 255*intensity) will result in shades of blue
 *        Using color (255*intensity, 255*intensity*intensity, 0) will results in combinations of red and green.
 *        Or you could get really complicated:
 *                  Color col;
 *                  if (f < 50) {
 *                      col = Color(0, 9, 5*f);
 *					} else {
 *                      col = Color(f - 50, 10*(f - 50), 255);
 *                  }
 *        (There is no rationale for this last -- it just produces nice pictures.)
